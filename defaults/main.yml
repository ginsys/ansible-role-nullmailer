## defaults file for nullmailer

# nullmailer gets installed and configured as the root user
# this should not change
nullmailer_become_user: root

#
## adminaddr and remotes are the variables that should at least be set
## to have some functional nullmailer
#

# If this file is not empty, all recipients to users at either "localhost" (the
# literal string) or the canonical host name (from /etc/mailname) are remapped
# to this address. This is provided to allow local daemons to be able to send
# email to "somebody@localhost" and have it go somewhere sensible instead of
# being bounced by your relay host.
nullmailer_adminaddr:       '' # empy string yields empty file

# This  file contains a list of remote servers to which to send each message.
# Each line of this file contains a remote host name or address followed by an
# optional protocol string, separated by white space. The protocol name defaults
# to smtp, and may be followed by command-line arguments for that module.
nullmailer_remotes:         []

#
## after this, defaults should be ok for most setups
#

# according to nullmailer docs, me should be equal to hostname
# but IMHO this must be fully qualified
nullmailer_me:              "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

# The content of this file is appended to any host name that does not contain
# a period (except localhost), including defaulthost and idhost.  Defaults to
# the value of the /etc/mailname system file, if it exists, otherwise the
# literal name defaultdomain.
nullmailer_defaultdomain:   "{{ ansible_domain }}"

# The content of this file is appended to any address that is missing a host
# name. Defaults to the value of the /etc/mailname system file, if it exists,
# otherwise the literal name defaulthost.
nullmailer_defaulthost:     "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"

# Sets the environment variable $HELOHOST which is used by the SMTP protocol
# module to set the parameter given to the HELO command.
nullmailer_helohost:        "{{ nullmailer_me }}"

# The content of this file is used when building the message-id string for the
# message. Defaults to the canonicalized value of defaulthost.
nullmailer_idhost:          "{{ nullmailer_defaulthost }}"

# The number of seconds to pause between successive queue runs when there are
# messages in the queue. If this is set to 0, nullmailer-send will exit
# immediately  after going through the queue once (one-shot mode).
nullmailer_pausetime:       60

# The number of seconds to wait for a remote module listed above to complete
# sending a message before killing it and trying again. If this is set to 0,
# nullmailer-send will wait forever for messages to complete sending.
nullmailer_sendtimeout:     3600

# /etc/mailname: The fully-qualifiled host name of the computer running
# nullmailer. Defaults to the literal name me.
